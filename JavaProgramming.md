### Ideas for Orientation

1. ConceptMap  - "the lay of the land" using Mindmup and/or ConceptMap for the 5 units; similar to this [polymorphism topic map]
2. Upfront **MCQ** - About 20-30 - aligned with intent to help them score well in assessments / final exams 
	- The 20 **WHY** Challenge Questions for Java 

3. Simplest Paint Application in Java - and run it through a Java Debugger
    - Equivalent of reading a good book
    - Single step through the program in Java Debugger
    - set up 3-4 line changes and how it impacts the functionality 
    - documentation printout
    - Refactor one or more of the github repos (links provided below) that are already existing 

5. Core Java **REFCARDZ** - as a self-guided motivator to a Java IT career **@KGISL**
	- 200+ Java assignments - on CloudCoder
