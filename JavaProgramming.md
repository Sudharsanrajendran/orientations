# Ideas for Orientation

### Suggested Artifacts
1. ConceptMap  - "the lay of the land" using Mindmup and/or ConceptMap for the 5 units; similar to this [polymorphism topic map]
2. Upfront **MCQ** - About 20-30 - aligned with intent to help them score well in assessments / final exams 
	- The 20 **WHY** Challenge Questions for Java 

3. Simplest Paint Application in Java - and run it through a Java Debugger
	- Show them how it all comes together!
    - Refactor one or more of the github repos (links provided below) that are already existing 
    - code printout for them to have on person 
    - Encourage them to read the "good book" and have clarifications
    - Single step through the program in Java Debugger (read-along session)
    - set up 3-4 line changes and how it impacts the functionality (_remix_ the story)

5. Core Java **REFCARDZ** - as a self-guided motivator to a Java IT career **@KGISL**
	- Complete the http://j.mp/rntJavaTDD problem (a non-graphical Integrated Artifact, can become full fledged with a *suitable* interface class )
	- 200+ Java assignments - on CloudCoder

6. Manual for the Java Labs with industry-standard keys for each of them 
	- Viva Q&A to be agreed upon for each of the lab exercises 
	- Run it like Continuous Assessment - amounting to 70% of the lab marks?
